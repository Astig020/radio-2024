## About

This repo is a ongoing project that I've always wanted to do; some nice visualizations accompanied of good music. Growing up playing with computers I always loved [demo scenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) and this is nothing but a homage to that era. It is important to me for you to know that I'm not the one supplying the radio aspect of the project, I'm using [SomaFM](http://somafm.com) services. Later I'll may be adding other web radio services, but that's not a priority right now. Please consider donating to SomaFm if you like the music they're streaming, to keep up the good service. [Donate here](http://somafm.com/support/).
